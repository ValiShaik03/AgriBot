**AI-powered advice for farmers and agri-students**

---

## **Overview**

AgriAssist is a context-aware agricultural assistant designed to provide instant, reliable answers to farmers and agri-students. Users can:

- Upload PDF manuals or crop guides for personalized advice.
- Ask questions related to crops, pests, fertilizers, irrigation, and government schemes.
- Receive responses in **Concise** or **Detailed** mode.

The app intelligently combines **local PDF knowledge** with **live web search** and **LLM-generated insights** to ensure accurate and timely information.

---

## **Why Live Web Search is Needed**

1. **Dynamic Nature of Agriculture Information**  
   Agricultural practices, government subsidies, crop prices, and pest alerts change frequently. Static PDFs or manuals cannot provide the latest updates.  

2. **LLM Quota & Knowledge Limits**  
   Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5-turbo have:  
   - Knowledge cutoff dates (e.g., Oct 2023)  
   - Quota limitations (API usage caps)  

   This means that relying solely on LLMs may result in **outdated or unavailable answers**.

3. **Fallback for Missing PDF Context**  
   - Users may not always upload PDFs.  
   - PDFs may not contain answers to all queries.  

   **Live web search ensures users still receive a relevant answer** when local context is insufficient.

4. **Real-Time Policy Updates**  
   Example:  
   - Query: *‚ÄúLatest subsidies for rice farmers in Maharashtra 2025‚Äù*  
   - A PDF guide may only include historical subsidies.  
   - DuckDuckGo abstracts may be generic.  
   - **SerpAPI live search fetches real-time government announcements or news**, providing actionable advice.

---

## **How Live Web Search Works**

1. **DuckDuckGo API**  
   - Provides quick abstracts and related topics.  
   - Used first as a lightweight, free search option.  
   - Limitation: May not always have the most recent data.

2. **SerpAPI (Google Search)**  
   - Used as a fallback if DuckDuckGo or PDF RAG doesn‚Äôt return relevant results.  
   - Fetches the top real-time Google search results.  
   - Summarizes snippets to provide actionable, up-to-date insights.  

This multi-step approach guarantees **reliable answers even when LLM fails or PDFs don‚Äôt cover the query**.
