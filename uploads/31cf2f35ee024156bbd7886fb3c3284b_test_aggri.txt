Maize (corn) is a staple cereal crop grown worldwide. Nitrogen is one of the most important nutrients for maize growth. 
Symptoms of nitrogen deficiency include yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, and poor yield. 

To treat nitrogen deficiency:
1. Apply a nitrogen-rich fertilizer, such as urea or ammonium nitrate, following recommended dosage.
2. Split fertilizer applications during the growing season to improve absorption.
3. Ensure proper irrigation, as water availability affects nutrient uptake.
4. Monitor soil pH and organic matter to optimize nitrogen availability.
